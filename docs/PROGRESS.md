# Jobcu progress

Jobcu is built in phases (see section 16 of [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md)). Each phase is finished,
tested and shown to the owner before the next one starts. Decisions are in
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

| Phase | What it delivers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Foundations | Project set-up; Jobcu starts with a double-click | ✅ Done (2026-09-17) |
| 1. Usable first version | A real search with ranked, deduplicated results and reasons | 🔨 In progress |
| 2. Smart location filter | Understands sentences like "a city by the seaside" | Planned |
| 3. Maximum coverage | Many more job sources in every supported country | Planned |
| 4. Ready for friends | Complete guides, first-run setup, tested on real Mac and Windows computers | Planned |

## Phase 0: Foundations ✅

- [x] Plan and technology explained to the owner in plain language
- [x] Tools installed on the owner's Mac (uv, which also installs Python)
- [x] Private GitHub repository created
- [x] Owner's keys obtained (his own AI provider, Adzuna, Reed) and kept in his password manager,
      never in the project. Steps written up in [guides/getting-your-keys.md](guides/getting-your-keys.md)
- [x] Project skeleton, `.gitignore`, key storage, separate local data folder
- [x] `docs/DECISIONS.md`, plain-language README, `LICENSE` notice, `docs/HANDOVER.md`
- [x] Safety check that blocks keys and personal data (before each commit and on GitHub)
- [x] Automatic tests on macOS and Windows, including starting Jobcu with the real launchers
- [x] Instructions for friends and their AI coding assistants: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md),
      [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- [x] **Done when:** Jobcu starts on the owner's Mac with one double-click and shows an empty
      screen. Confirmed by the owner on 2026-09-17.
- Backups: the owner decided GitHub is enough (see DECISIONS.md)

## Phase 1: Usable first version 🔨

- [x] Universal AI provider layer: native Anthropic, Google Gemini and OpenAI, plus a generic
      OpenAI-compatible option; rate-limit handling; setup check (HANDOVER §13)
- [x] Settings screen: choose provider and model, enter keys (saved only on the computer),
      test the AI connection and the Adzuna and Reed keys
- [x] Owner entered his keys in Jobcu and all three tests pass (2026-09-17)
- [x] CV and cover letter upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and reading, with a "What Jobcu understood"
      preview of the profile (§3, §4)
- [x] First real test on the owner's own documents (2026-09-17): 8 seconds, about 5,500 tokens
- [x] Owner confirmed "What Jobcu understood" is right (2026-09-17). He is open to any field of
      electronic hardware design (power electronics preferred, aerospace and defence also of
      interest) and will put this in his generic cover letter
- [x] Search screen: location box, "Posted within", job types, "Don't include remote jobs",
      live progress, "What Jobcu understood" and "Search details" (§3)
- [x] Simple location input: explicit places and countries; other conditions shown as "not
      checked yet" until Phase 2 (§6)
- [x] Hidden multilingual search words: English plus the job-ad languages of the countries
      searched (§5). First real run: 73 search words in 4 languages, about 10 seconds
- [x] Time filter and job type filter applied to the jobs found (§7, §8)
- [x] Starter sources: Adzuna, Bundesagentur für Arbeit, Reed (§9). Company career systems moved to
      Phase 3 (see DECISIONS.md)
- [x] Duplicate detection with main-link priority, "Also on" and "possible duplicate" (§10)
- [x] Rules filter and quick relevance check, with counts and left-out titles in Search details
- [ ] Quality test set of 30–50 real job ads judged by the owner, and a tuned scoring prompt (§13)
- [x] Scoring with 1–3 reasons per job (§11). First real search (Munich, 72 hours): 46 ads,
      41 different jobs, 22 scored, under 2 minutes
- [x] Results screen with Save / Applied / Not interested, "New" badge, Saved and Applied lists,
      "Show hidden", sorting, "Posting date unknown" section (§12)
- [x] Owner decided Jobcu may read Adzuna's job pages for full ads; now 18+ of 22 jobs are scored
      from full ads in a real search
- [x] Scoring limit that asks before scoring more (§13)
- [ ] Usage meter (per search and per month), monthly limits and price table in Settings (§13)
- [ ] **Done when:** the owner can run a real search on his Mac and get a ranked, deduplicated list
      with reasons.

## Phase 2: Smart location filter

- [ ] Location interpretation shown with the results, with an Edit option
- [ ] Reference datasets from HANDOVER §6 (places, boundaries, coastlines, UK sponsor register,
      German election results, country facts)
- [ ] **Done when:** all example sentences in HANDOVER §6 behave as described.

## Phase 3: Maximum coverage

- [ ] Source registry for every supported country (§9.0)
- [ ] All source types from §9.2–9.6: more career systems and the employer directory (the generic
      `JobPosting` reader already exists since Phase 1 and reads Adzuna's job pages)
- [ ] General live AI web search
- [ ] Per-source status, unique-job counts and on/off settings
- [ ] **Done when:** the coverage test shows no large avoidable gaps, and the remaining gaps are
      explained to the owner.

## Phase 4: Ready for friends

- [ ] Full manual test on a real Windows computer and a real Mac
- [ ] Complete everyday-user guides (§2.1), tested on clean computers
- [ ] First-run setup screen and polished double-click launchers
- [ ] Updating from GitHub while keeping the data folder
- [ ] Move the repository to a free GitHub organization and invite friends, choosing with the owner
      how friends can contribute (see DECISIONS.md)
